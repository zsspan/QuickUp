# Welcome to QuickUp!

Welcome to QuickUp, the all-in-one task manager and note creation app! This chrome web app allows you to create dynamic notes with a rich-text-editor and save them to Chrome's local storage. No information is kept and the program is 100% secure. More info and further instructions are given in both the PDF in the root folder and by pressing the 'i' icon in the actual app.

The program is also currently pending approval on the Chrome Web Store, allowing for universal easy access.
